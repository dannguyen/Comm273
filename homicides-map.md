Homicide Map

There are a lot of deficiencies to this kind of map, but the most predominant one is the fact that the larger the dot is, the more area it coveres. This means that it is very difficult to accurately approximate where these homicides took place. Additonally, since many of the dots overlap each other, the viewer can't know exactly how the data was compiled (by city, by latitude, by state, etc) because all they will see is a varying number of dots and no clear labels. These are particularly problematic issues when looking at the map from a very zoomed out perspective. The more you zoom in, the further away and more accurate the dots will become. So in this case, a screenshot is especially difficult to read because you can't zoom in on an area to see a more accurate distribution of dots by location.
